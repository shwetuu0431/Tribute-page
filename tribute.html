<h3>Childhood and Early Life of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h3>
<p>
    Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha kingdom of India.

    Shivaji Maharaj who was the descendant of a line of prominent nobles was very brave and fought many wars to consolidate India. 
    At that time, India was under the Muslim rulers and divided.
    The Mughals were in north India and the Muslim sultans of Bijapur as well as of Golconda in the south of India. 
    The ancestral estates of Shivaji Maharaj were situated in the Deccan region in the realm of Bijapur sultans.
    He found the suppression of the Muslim rulers and the persecution of all the Hindus in the region. He was sad due to the devastating condition of the Hindus that by the age of 16 he convinced himself to be the cause of the Hindu’s freedom. 
    It was a conviction that was to sustain him throughout his whole life.

<h3>Independent Sovereign (Purna Swaraj) </h3>
<p>
    In 1674 during the summer, Shivaji Maharaj had himself enthroned with great fanfare as an independent sovereign. 
    The entire suppressed Hindu majority rallied to him as their great leader.
    He ruled his domain for almost six years through a cabinet of eight ministers. 
    Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj who devout Hindu, who prided himself on the protector of his religion, broke the tradition by commanding that two of his relatives who had been forcibly converted to Islam should be taken back to Hinduism. 
    Even though both the Christians, as well as the Muslims often kept on imposing their creeds on the population by force, he respected the beliefs and protected the religious places of both communities. 
    Along with Hindus, many Muslims were also in his service. After his coronation, his most remarkable campaign was in the south. 
    During this campaign, he allied with the Sultans and blocked the grand design of the Mughals to spread their rule over the entire subcontinent.

<h3>The Rise of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h3>
<p>
   By the 16th Century, The Deccan region of India came under the rule of the Mughal Empire established in Delhi. 
   The uplands of Maratha were captured by the Adilshahi Sultanate on its north, a tributary state of the Mughal Emperor.  
   Shahaji Bhonsle was established as the chieftain of this region which belonged to the family of Bhonsle clan. Later, he became a rebel and started campaigns and raids against the Mughal Empire establishing forts. 
   However, he was supported by the Bijapur government but was never successful. So he had to run from fort to fort with his Jijabai and son Shivaji. The condition in which Shivaji grew up made him a great king later. 
   By 16, he had his band of fighters and continued the fight for Shahaji. In 1647, he took over the administration of Poona against the Bijapur government.
   This was a major step and led to conflict with Bijapur. Subsequently, in a concise period, he also captured the forts of Purandhara, Kondhana, and Chakan. 
   Then Supa, Baramati, and Inderpuri came into control of Shivaji Maharaj. The loot gathered helped him to build a capital fort at Raigad. 
   Shivaji Maharaj is more famous for the new military tactics he formulated and used to fight his enemies in such terrains. 
   This new method of gorilla tactics helped him to capture many forts within no time and brought a significant portion of the region under his control.
